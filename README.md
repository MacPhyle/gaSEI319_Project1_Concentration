# CONCENTRATION | A memory card game
## by Elizabeth Whitmire

I do much playing of a certain game that includes minigames, and one of those minigames is a memory match game. When the game developers first began including the memory game as part of that favorite game of mine, I hated having my memory tested, because I seemed to be pretty bad at it. I avoided parts of the game where I was likely to get the memory minigame. But over time, more and more of what I wanted to do in the game included the memory minigame, so I played it more and more, and I started to get pretty good at it. So I figured that as I learn coding, making my own memory match game could be a good project for me. And it was!

## Where to Get Playing

CONCENTRATION is available on the Web at this link:



If that link doesn't work, please download the code files and run the project from your code editor.

## Game Description

A field of 18 cards will be set before you, face down (all with the same back side image). Begin the game simply by touching a card. That card will flip, showing the front side image. Click another card to flip it, and if the two match, they'll stay flipped, and you'll get 10 points added to your score. Get all cards matched before the timer stops! To play again, click the New Game button. The score accumlates from game to game; it doesn't reset when a new game is begun, unless you start the game in a new browser tab or refresh the page.

## Why Play CONCENTRATION?

This game will test your brain, and your memory will improve. (I, for example, can attest that my memory has improved after some time playing memory match games.) When playing, the visuals are pretty nice (all A.I. generated in Photoshop).

## What I Learned

What I learned while creating CONCENTRATION was that creation of this simple game was a more difficult undertaking than I ever imagined. And more strenuous projects are ahead of me, I'm sure.

## License and Other Stuff

Please see the included Creative Commons license. No authentication is needed to play.

## Future Features:

- I still have some debugging to do: there's a "can't find the variable 'index'" error, and I don't know why, but hey - the game works! So there.

- And for some reason, the placement of the div that contains the cards is off-centered on the page. So I have this to figure out as well.

- Making matches gradually reveals a large image beneath the board.

- The user can choose the size of the board. (How many rows/columns).

- Or alternatively to the user choosing the board size, maybe I'll make the board size increase (and card size decrease) as the score reaches certain milestones.

- There's a start button that when clicked, it makes all the cards flip, and they stay flipped for 5 seconds, then the turn back to their original state, and the timer starts running down.
